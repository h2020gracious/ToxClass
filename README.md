# ToxClass
A suite of ststistical classification, QSAR and clustering models for regulatory risk assessment.

Simulated data are produced (dummy_classification_dataset.R). Real well-known data are also analysed (Griznic et al. (2015) physicochemical data), Solubility data (Tetko et al. (2001) and Huuskonen (2000)), and Aquatic data (He and Jurs (2005)).
